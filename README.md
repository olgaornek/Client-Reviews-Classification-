The core goal of project is to create a predictive model that reads customer messages and accurately assigns each one to the correct subject category.

## The steps of the project:

- Data Preparation: cleaning and transforming the raw text data by tokenization and stop word removal.

- Feature Engineering: converting cleaned text into a numerical format using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.

- Model Training: Logistic Regression or Random Forest models are trained and compared to find the best predictor.

- Performance Evaluation: The models are tested using performance metrics like the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure their reliability.

- Business Insight Extraction: Finally, the results are synthesized into a comprehensive BI report or dashboard, providing actionable visual insights on issue trends, volume, and model effectiveness to support strategic decision-making in customer service and resource allocation.
